"""# Saturnin management console

The primary tool for interacting with Saturnin via the command line.
It operates in two primary modes:

1.  **Console Mode (REPL)**:

When invoked without any commands or arguments (i.e., just `saturnin`),
it launches an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop. The set of commands available in console
mode might differ slightly from direct mode.
This mode offers enhanced features such as:

*   Command and parameter auto-completion.

*   Interactive help (`?` or `?<command>`).

*   Persistent command history.

2.  **Direct Mode**:

When invoked with a command and its arguments (e.g., `saturnin list services`), it executes
the specified command directly and then exits. Some commands, particularly those for one-time
setup or infrequent operations (like `initialize` or `create home`), are typically available
only in this mode. For technical reasons, commands `pip`, `install package` and `uninstall package`
are available only in **console mode**.

---

\b
The CLI dynamically loads commands from registered entry points, including
core commands, application-specific commands, and commands generated from
installed recipes.

# Saturnin management console

Saturnin was invoked in **console** mode that provides command and parameter completion,
interactive help and persistent command history. The command set available in this mode may
differ from command set available in **direct** mode (see below).

When saturnin is invoked with additional parameters, it executes specified command and exists.
Some commands (typically those required to run only once or not very often like *initialize*
or *create home*) are available only in this **direct** mode.
