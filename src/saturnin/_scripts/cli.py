This mode runs REPL that provides advanced functionality like command and parameter completion,
interactive help and persistent command history. The command set available in this mode
may differ from command set available in **direct** mode (see below).

When saturnin is invoked with additional parameters, it executes specified command and exists.
Some commands (typically those required to run only once or not very often like *initialize*
or *create home*) are available only in this **direct** mode.
